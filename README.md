# dbs_coGBA
Looking into GBA mutation in PD-DBS treated patients.

Data were kept in iTEMPO (First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague) internal database and extracted via [scripts from my data management repository](https://www.github.com/josefmana/dbs_dataMANA).

The [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package was used to create reproducible environment for the project. To set-up R environment for reproduction of our results, run the following in R:
```
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```
